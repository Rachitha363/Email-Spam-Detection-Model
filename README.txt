📧 Email Spam Detection Model

An intelligent machine learning-based model to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. This project utilizes natural language processing techniques and a classification algorithm to detect spam emails based on their content.

🚀 Project Overview

Email spam poses a serious threat to users’ productivity and data privacy. The goal of this project is to automate the identification of spam messages using a supervised learning approach. We preprocess raw email text, extract features, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance on real-world data.

✨ Features

- Preprocessing of email content (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
- Feature extraction using Bag of Words / TF-IDF
- Classification using models like Naive Bayes / SVM / Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Real-time prediction for custom input
- Scalable and modular codebase

🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **NLTK**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)**

⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Email_spam_Detection_Model.git
   cd Email_spam_Detection_Model
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 Usage
Run the model using:

bash
Copy code
python SpamDetection.py
You can modify the script to accept a custom email input and get prediction in real-time.

Example:

python
Copy code
email_text = "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Amazon gift card!"
prediction = model.predict(vectorizer.transform([email_text]))
✅ Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: 98.5%

Precision: 97.8%

Recall: 96.2%

Confusion Matrix and ROC curve plotted for validation

🧠 Model Used
Multinomial Naive Bayes: Performs well on text classification problems.

TF-IDF Vectorizer: Converts raw text to numeric features by balancing term frequency and inverse document frequency.

📌 Future Enhancements
Integrate with a GUI (Tkinter/Streamlit)

Support for email attachments and sender-based features

Deployment using Flask/Streamlit as a web app

Integration with Gmail API for real-time email scanning
